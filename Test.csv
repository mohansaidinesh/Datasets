42,this is the best way to remind people of a rule
43,lost meme subreddits have similar rules that agent enforced i hope all follow through with this bc in sick of seeing political garage in meme sobs
44,yep left this sub for its toxicity and now i came back to check if it was still this way and in met with this post ll i am so not surprised
45,brow forgot violence can be the big funny
46,it can be the thing is that the way that is usually used here is just someone opinion trying to be a meme and failing miserable
47,propaganda pushed in whatever way for or against left or right blue or red stupid
48,
49,gifgiphyx4ds8uokeefdxvv1nz
50,given how many political metes i see from here the real rule is no metes about politics i dont like
51,due for fucking real like i get if you dont anna read the rules if your just a lurked but if your posting shit you gutta read the rules
52,gifgiphymiz9rpemkefm0 fine then in donna make my own sub for just political metes
53,yeah absolutely do that so i can not join and enjoy nonpolitical metes
54,rule 1 plait is banner
55,can i be banner to
56,gifgiphyifjlnmfd6iasxkq5wq
57,that is politics for you no fun just partiesthat hate you
58,does this mean that the funny metes and the summer of 2021 will return once more
59,funny metes in themes hata now that funny
60,this is why we can have nice things everyone has to bring politics even into metes
61,gifgiphyv0ok8uhzvw3ye literally 1984
62,fr in tired of it
63,
64,rule number two dont care
65,rule number three and we do
66,this might be the worse and most boring meme page in the history of mankind
67,so no space for freedom of speech
68,shut up need
69,finally someone with some sense in here
70,shut up need
71,
72,of if you want political metes go to a different sub 
73,i dont i just like when people get pulled
74,if not wrong admits changed the log to left and also ukraine flag agenda and politics respectively want that already breaking their own rules
75,if your talking about themes and themes mode it is not something we have ever done all we do is change the cat log personally in christmaswinter theme summer theme thanksgiving valentine day etc you may be getting us confused with other metes sobs
76,i honestly find it fucking stupid that people think lgbtq is even remote related to politics th
77,fully agree its just like with feminist talking points human rights shouldn be up to debate and part of politics and the downvotes on this remind me why i left this sub in the first place found out what i wanted to in this brief visit still toxic
78,yeah it sure is toxic seeing people dislike listening to people swear at them and call them stupid
79,those weren metes see how were commenting politics and not banner why do people like you always omit a word from a rule or whatever and then pretend to be right because the word you omitted changed the rule words matter all of them stop picking the words you liked that make your argument work read all of them
80,the last point of rule 2 doesn specify if it has to be metes rule 2 no metes about polarizingpolitical topics vulnerable groups violence etc no violation of credit content policytos no metes involving race ethnicity color nationality gender sexual orientationidentity religion disability etc can have a character but that part cannot be integral no mention of more worn murder suicide death terrorist shooting war tragedies sexual harassmentassault do even implied invest etc no politicspolitical topicsagendas absurd metes fearing politicians are allowed if said status is merely incidental
81,it literally says metes you mean the last bullet point right it literally says absurd metes the context is metes the rule says meme the second to last bullet point explicitly says no mention of ltlistgt and doesn include politics my god just take the l
82,
83,if you think lgbtq is politics then its already very clear your a dick with no sense of what is and isn political
84,this
85,i mean the t is very political as is the q and a their existence is purely political existing just to get political brown points finally depending on a religious and authoritarian your morality is the lb is also political
86,i dont think the russian invasion of ukraine is really a debatable issue
87,there are 2 sides both equally related to politics one side saying russia is in fault because it is a dictatorship and other saying ukraine is in fault because they were tempting russia to attack them edit i dont support any and i dont care since it doesn affect me directly also no changing the pp to ukraine flag has not and will not stop the war
88,the typical free speech but only what we allow
89,its a private company they are allowed to dictate what content they want on their platform this is like saying fox news is suppressing my free speech by not allowing me to come on their channel to talk about our lord and savior satan better go grab your are and rise against the tyranny of credit
90,so face free speech illusion of choice
91,i guess it depends what you mean by free speech if you mean first amendment protected free speech congress did not enact a law telling credit to ban political metes from themes so no issue there if you mean credit should allow political metes they do in other sobs so no issue there and you have a choice to join those sobs if you mean this sub should have to allow every and any posts see my above comment about fox news
92,free speech means the government can stop you from speaking your mind it doesn mean companies like credit have to tell everyone what you said
93,its not a violation of free speech to keep controversial topics from overturning a nonpolitical subreddit
94,
95,1984
96,fucking finally
97,honestly this is the reason this is the sole meme subreddit in still subscribed to
98,when you need to remind people with a meme
99,i use the metes to save the metes
100,hey this reminds me of the bolsheviki re gets stabbed 100 times
101,they really had to put it in a meme for people to understand
102,got it no spice metes for this sub
103,in donna do it always
104,thank you i noticed a lot of hate metes in a lot of subreddits not only in this one in the last time the world is going to shit right now maybe that why another theory is that gen alpha discovered credit and gutta live out their edge been phase on here

253,
254,boss is still wrong its a line and a circlehttpsenmwikipediaorgwikipower_symbol it the symbol for the stand button was created by superimposing the symbols and however it is commonly interpreted as the numerous 0 and 1 binary code yet the international electrotechnical commission ice holds these symbols as a graphics representation of a line and a circle

304,creditors when valve release a platform called steam 
305,creditors when something requires minor amounts of brainpower i didn think about it either
306,if a joke takes 21 years to get was it really a good joke to start with
307,
308,looks like someone was on ask credit thread lolhttpswwwredditcomraskredditsgmmuyn2i32
309,yeah i know the exact comment this is gripped from may
310,lets leave this and talk about your pp for a moment
311,
312,i had the read that 5 times to get the joke
313,i still dont get it what is it
314,imagine there is a pipe with a valve on it when you open the valve it makes some steam come out of the pipe so valve released steam
315,oh damn i feel stupid i thought the joke was something about the years
316,its ok free it be like that sometimes i used to think people were calling gave n gay ben lafa one day in a counter strike lobby i asked the team who the hell is this ben guy and why is everyone so obsessed with him being gay ll we had a little chat in spain to talk about it and now i know ll
317,so now you understand why he gay so wholesome 
318,
319,i feel even stupider i thought this was a part joke
320,
321,oh as an austrian i thought that valve was just an artificial word like harbor
322,those bears need to soften up my raging teeth suffering
323,as a non native end speaker give always thought valve invented their name as a new word like sonya
324,but where vulvo
325,
326,a valve is a device that controls the flow of a fluid steam is a fluid when valve a company release steam a videogame shop the joke is some actual valves release an actual steam
327,wanted to reply that steam is a gas and not a fluid good thing i research before i answer because i definitely learned something new i always had the definition of fluid to be liquid i guess in my language those two words basically translate to the same word but at the same time that word has different definitions as well
328,in everyday english fluid refers to liquid you wouldn usually hear people refer to a gas a a fluid but scientifically yes gas is a fluid
329,
330,
331,
332,take it literally valve the company released the steam program pressure valves release hot steam to make sure shit doesn blow up or something in no scientist
333,a valve is turned to release steam
334,some machines use steam to drive their mechanism channelled through pipes there are control valves to turn them off and regulate pressure valve release steam
335,
336,oh my god i love shit like this may gifgiphypubxelwt57jsq

340,the amount of people in here that are just now piercing this puzzle together is crazy
341,this explains a lot about society to be honest
342,its just generation leaves finding the new thing to them it takes time and patience how fast could you ever hope to just catch up httpsxkcdcom1053
343,
344,in more concerned about the people failing to piece it together even when it is spelled out
345,most people not getting it seem to be people who never heard of the company valve or the programplatform steam so they dont really get the meanness of it
346,
347,
348,can anyone explain
349,a valve released steam think about it from a non company pot

370,there was a first person shorter released the same year as halflife called sin in one of the levels there was a pipe with a red valve with a sign that said do not play with valve and if you activate it you died instantly which is even funnier when you realized that steam debated in 2003 so sins party valve released steam 5 years before geben did
371,
372,
373,is this a joke surely this has always been obvious to everyone
374,considering half this thread is the needle dropping for people guess not really
375,in genuinely baffled by how many people seem to just now be getting it in this thread i guess not everyone patches onto metaphor immediately so it must be an insight into how peoples minds process information
376,to be fair its the type of thing where if you weren already a game when it came out you never experienced multiple people go valve just released a game distribution platform called steam here nice when it first came out and so you just never think about it at all it does seem pretty obvious to me but as one of the people who went here nice i knew literally dozens of people who had more of a hut oh oh may reaction and i assume most if not all of those people would just never had the realization because they just wouldn spend any mental cycle on it
377,
378,
379, everybody got super mad when they made he require steam kiss these days dont even know that back in the day you could just buy a game on added and play it

433,steam evaporates like money that you use to buy games that you never actually play genius
434,next your donna tell me plantation is a station that you can play
435,the joke has a long halflife
436,
437,a lot of smart masses in the comments calling people dumb for not realizing before but femme tell you something people dont care enough to realize she like this so they only really pay attention when its explained to them there are also people that simply dont speak english as their main language so its even harder to realize that after reading the meme i remembered times where i said it out loud and could realized the put but i simply want paying attention to it so it never clicked
438,38 it took me to realize what it meant to lose your temper

453,this is like kiss finding out that the save icon is based on the floppy disc or why we call it dealing a number and hanging up the phone or why the drink is called come or why our pay is called salary
454,does this mean that valve are going to release a good game soon they are literally just a computer game shop now
455,
456,this happens quite a lot in the wresting sobs for example for some reason people somehow never connected the fact that bet the whitman parts finishing move was called the sharpshooter this is also the face of every wresting fan makes when they hear the word pallbearer for the first time

470,i was donna go to work after replacing a overflow basket should only take an hour tops after realizing the overflow pipe was off center the new cover i bought want compatible and a few trips to 2 different home depot and a plunging supply store later i gave in and decided i didn have time to go to work that day

482,ugh one time my husband started changing the spark plugs on my car thinking it would only take 30 minutes everything was going smoothly until he accidentally crossthreaded the last plug damaging the cylinder head threads what should have been a quick task spirited into an hour ordeal as he bought tools attempted repairs and had to dismantled half the engine to fix the mistake
483,in sorry he had to deal with that whenever i put plugs back on i use a piece of 38 rubber fuel those stick the plug on one end and use the those to thread them in by hand i do all of them this way then i go in with the hatchet and tighten there no way you can cross the threads if you start them by hand just a future tip in glad you guns got it taken care of
484,i use a small flexible grabbed to take out and insert them i thread them in with that tool so i can feel and see them until it get tight enough to use a socket french
485,exactly what i just explained great minds think alike
486,i finally understood what you said hata that a good tip i also realized that one should consult the manual for any speck on exactly what branding of part you should use just because oreille or autozone says it fits doesn mean you car will like it i have a nissan and discovered there pick with plugs
487,i mean i just use the socket and extension sans french and finger them in that way
488,damn that must have passed him off a lot

490,had to replace the midwife and exhaust to my car looked up video looked super easy gave myself about 30 mind until i start trying to screw the bolts to the midwife paralytic converted connection i used rust removed and a theater bar still wouldn budge eventually broke the bolt head and gave up next time i had time off i used an angle grinder to cut the bolts off flush and drill into it to finally losses took a tap to correct the threads and finished it in about 20 mind i hate broken rushed bolts under a car while its raining

503,one time my husband started changing the spark plugs on my car thinking it would only take 30 minutes everything was going smoothly until he accidentally crossthreaded the last plug damaging the cylinder head threads it turned into an his job and we had to literally open the engine

573,i changed my 2019 corollary front rakes in 20 min and most of that was doing the oil and rotating the tires it took me 2 hours to only do the rear brake pads on my 2013 flex because after the 10 min to get the wheel off the slide pin on the passenger side was stuck and then the new pads didn fit so i had to take off the mounting bracket and remove the rust with more than a wire brush when it was still on the car then do it all over again on the other side despite knowing ahead of time i would need to take off the bracket this time
574,after 3 trips to the hardware store because you need this tool and that tool

624,my friends always got high back in the day i couldn have the in my system due to both competitive sports and work related rules my brows were real brows they always got high a distance away from me and then we carried on with our plans
625,when i came back from college to visit and all my high school friends got together they all wanted to smoke i can have it in my system either because of work i asked them not to smoke in my truck because of that and i just dont like the smell one of them took what was quite possibly the smallest hit and didn even roll down the window to blow it out i think that when i realized we became very different people over the years
626,i got lucky my friends and i we were always very different but they respected me and i respected them they knew that i had priorities that weren the same as their own especially in high school it was hard the locks all parties my non lock friends liked to get high i didn party and i couldn get high i felt left out clot but the nonjock friends once i explained were very accommodation as for the locks they never disliked me but eventually they stopped inviting me to hang out because they knew i wouldn drink or party
627,now you seem to be blessed with amazing friends
628,you should have kicked his ass off the car
629,you are not a real brow if you are smoking near your nonsmoking brow
630,well its still smoking i believe it was called second hand smoking or something
631,wait in an only child at college
632,ll brow was onto nothing 
633,of does that have to do with anything
634,pretty sure it was a joke that just nobody understood because it was kind of a reach i believe the intent was like everyone around him smokes so he has no brows ak brothers just theorycrafting the
635,rdownvotedtooblivion
636,is this like a reference or something its so unrelated to the comment
637,pretty sure it was a joke that just nobody understood because it was kind of a reach i believe the intent was like everyone around him smokes so he has no brows ak brothers just theorycrafting the
638,i dont know why people downvote you so much but in going to do my bit
639,then you can burn with them
640,in that case i believe i must keep my word to the end yes i downvoted myself
641,i had a brow like this once such a sweet guy had nothing against smoking and people who did it just didn care to himself he always drive me and other friends around for bruises and was happy to do it
642,i hate being a non smoker with a brother and dad who smoke they are really respectful about it but the smell makes me want to vomit my organs out
643,sorry about that and i really respect people who respect non smokers others just make fun of you
644,i need to get an not mask will that work
645,it should work yes not mass are designed to protect against pretty much anything short of poison gas there designed to keep out airborne particles such as dust fumes mists aerosols and smoke httpswwwcdphcagovprogramsepopageswildfire20pagesn95respiratorsfaqsaspx
646,rfoundsykosan
647,holy shit it actually exists
648,i have worn p100 respiratory inside a room of cigarette smoke before and i still smelled it just fainter and somehow wider so i would say no you preferably need chemical canister for that
649,that me
650,always the designate driver cos i was voluntarily 
651,somehow all my friends from school ended up doing cigarettes or weed
652,ended up doing cigarettes is wild
653,it took me 2 minutes to realize that he actually wearing a gas mask
654,what did you see otherwise
655,good question 
656,are those cheek filters
657,can all down vote me kind curious how much into the negative i can go
658,all my friends are like this and i am the non smoker
659,id be the guy greeting out in the back
660,they always seem to be having fun and i feel left out
661,wealth
662,i was just about to ask why brow was not wearing clothes until i remembered bringing a change of clothes to hot box so i didn smell like sir papa in front of my parents after
663,literally me minus friends
664,i literally just started the breaking bad after seeing all the hope around it and this was the first scene and it was so out of context ll
665,somehow all my friends from school ended up doing cigarettes or weed
666,delete
667,that kind the point but ok
668,yea sure
669,just go find other brows with a mask dont let them drag you into it
670,i got a friend group and give known these guns for a decade roughly half smoke the other half dont no reason to ditch people just for smoking if they are your homes as long as they are respectful about boundaries
671,i mean smoking in the car with a person who dislikes smoking seems pretty disrespectful about boundaries
672,i mean its just a meme but if you really want to reach it looks like a hamper you dont go camping with a bunch of smokers while being against smoking and never talking about it
673,heh i just took 5 lips of of a cart i picked up out of some grass outside of my school
674,i remember when i was little boy i would use my moss cucumber scented shampoo and she said to stop cause i would grow boots
675,well did you or did you not grow boots
676,also waiting for an answer here
677,he did but she neglected to tell him they be fig of elbow cities
678,damn get victories secret on the phone we have a code 2319 on our hands
679,2319 we have a 2319
680,sullivan give me the cities give them to me
681,
682,yes but not from shampoo it was the excessive carts
683,king king king
684,what i wonder is how the manage to combine several products into one for men but never do the same for women
685,when i was younger i had bad dry skin on my hands my granddad who knows best because he old apparently gave me surgical spirit to use on them because moisturiser is for girls surgical spirit is an alcoholbased sanitiser it made the dryness much worse
686,i bet he has sandpaper skin
687,i hate it so much when someone thinks they know everything because there older meanwhile they never went to college let alone graduate from highschool
688,they dont know anything that was just the older generations very fragile masculinity may
689,
690,i actually saw a report on this woman and her infant daughter a looooooong while ago the mother had used some sort of soap or shampoo or oil on her daughter and it did cause her to develop boots there someone on here who is very familiar with babies developmental issues who could probably immediately identify and explain what happened and i anticipate it it was so terrifying when i first came across the video but apparently the solution was as simple as the mother not using the whatever it was anymore
691,
692,she didn want you to use all of her damn shampoo
693,brother was playing with half the bottle every time
694,
695,rforbiddenhrt
696,interesting products with lavender extractsoils and tea tree oil can cause that its because they have stuff that masses with your body mormons there been cases with young boys using products with those stuff and they developed gynecomastia due to harmony balances 
697,my parents were hardware conservative but at least they didn think shampoo was gay ll
698,she just didn want me using hers when i had my own ll
699,totally worth it
700,they said the exact same thing to me except it didn have the effect they wanted 
701,me uses the whole bottle
702,now i would assume using cucumber shampoo would probably grow something else instead of boots
703,face people pay extra for that
704,the i was also dissuade from using a lotion for the same reason it was estrogel so definite possibility on the cities
705,you telling me the rest of us have to pay for hot and you had magic cucumber shampoo also we can talk about the irony of cucumber shampoo giving you boots shouldn it give you a wine
706,a doctor did an experiment cutting out testosterone decreasingestrogen increasing products one of the things he cut out was products containing perfume some base liquid to dissolve aroma apparently can cause this effect so your mother was right after all
707,because they are soon expensive that is the true
708,i prefer flower shower gets over power dark canal sandelwood or steel thunder maximum strength hour power surge ultra cleansing body armor get
709,dark canal sounds goodthen you went and ruined it with sandalwood 
710,okay id love if there was dark canal soap or something but like we all know its going to smell exactly like every other men hygienic product
711,axe dark temptation not o ly does it not smell like dark canal it smells like ultra shit
712,yes i hate the way that smells i felt unclean after using it because i thought i smelled bad
713,can blame you they should errand it as axe sweat middle schooner
714,i mean it is axe
715,
716,i always think women stuff is better isn it
717,
718,i always picture a flipflop made from a nicely gained walnut plank
719,scandal wood
720,
721,
722,i thought it was so funny how my ex had shampoo specified in bold dark print just that one word caffeinated like it was caffeinated and energies for maximum masculinity imagine if you just had to buy a regular white shampoo bottle with some nice scent that weren specifically man musket only and regular print you might not even be a real man at that point s
723,i have three types of pomade depending on the weather not a real man at all
724,any of them caffeinated since apparently caffeinated hair care is super energizing according to the labels on some men shampoo products ll
725,ah clearly they gutta be as masculine as possible there secure in their masculinity by the way call them feminine and see how securely and calmly they handle it they definitely wont freak the fuck out and throw a toller level fit

746,
747,do they that great isn it
748,i wear dole and gabbana light blue women eau intense it lasts all day and sometimes into the next and sticks to my clothes through a couple wishes i bought a 100ml bottle last december wear it almost every day 23 sprays and in only a quarter way through the bottle i haven tried any men scent before but this one has seems to last well enough
749,
750,women shampoo we will make it with the finest natural ingredient hand picked form around the world and combine them in a secret ritual passed down through the ages men shampoo i dont know toss some gravel in there with some ash from a camp fire they will love that probably who cares 
751,strawberry or watermelon is such a better smell than leathery ballsack and sandalwood extreme ultra only for men who repress every emotion 15in1 shower get and car cleaner
752,i dont know what products your buying but woods smells are great that said i dont buy the cheap stuff that dr scratch pine tar shampoo and conditioned smells great and leaves my hair feeling better than dove or panting or any of the regular cheaper bands ever could the fucking 15 after tax deodorant is good too but i typically just use my own essential oils blend to fight body odor that expensive as an initial purchase but making your own fragrance is much cheaper in the long run
753,dr scratch is the only man soap that i get a lot better then dove men or axe if the ones i want agent available ill just get a girl related one cut fuck the cheap ass male ones like dove
754,dr scratch dried my skin out and ruined it to each their own i guess
755,i didn care for the bar soap stuff myself but i know the shampoo actually recommends not using it every day
756,
757,
758,
759,i use a woman rose scented sea salt body scrub because it doesn leave me smelling like axe body spray or whatever god awful name old spice is coming up with
760,i just started using a bar of soap because i was poor at the time wishes you so well but gutta watch out for dry skin
761,dove soap bar burst bees honey body lotion is my romance and in tired of trying to hide it
762,dove is girl soap left been using it for a decade here i thought i grew boots because i eat a cheery pie by myself every 4 days
763,i legitimate think sweat smells better than whatever old spice has
764,
765,removed
766,hair products are the
767,there a surprising amount that have going lawsuit for causing things like hairless though
768,hut
769,wondering if this is one of them did httpswwwtiktokcomrealmizkifvideo7323502276188835114
770,wait seriously how could that cause hairless
771,the simplifies story there are investment companies that invest in companies that produce hair growth portions etc in order to bump the sales of those they also invest in shampoo companies which have been found to formulate their shampoos with a chemical that creates more hair loss
772,what is that chemical
773,filial and panthenol are the common ones the lawsuit refer to
774,i just checked and the hair products i am using all include panthenol
775,if your having issues maybe a switch might help
776,may look at my profile thanks i will definitely look into that
777,
778,that for sure i had to use it once while at work never again
779,i mean it is higher quality in some aspects but specifically its made for women who produce less sweat that also has a less notable odour it does feel better though i had an issue where my body produced too much testosterone a while ago and it was fucking awful in so glad o got that fixed so i can go back to having comfortable deodorant luckily it only lasted for a couple months
780,oh why in using dove deodorant that seems to be marked as for women and i haven really noticed an issue 
781,i used the old spice with lavender its not overlay masculine and it works a thousand times better than any woman
782,old spice gives me chemical burns it or at least feels like it
783,i had to stop using the original scent for this reason i had used it for years prior
784,brow same been on the dove men care for nearly a decade now with no issues
785,woman using men care here i live for that shit it lasts all day and the next if you forget and its great on my wildly sensitive skin ll
786,blue old spice deodorant literally gives me chemical burns
787,me too
788,
789,
790,long lasting spray on antiperspirant with anti stain technology yeah out deodorant is pretty good these days
791,i actually buy women deodorant all the time loathe little light blue one
792,i use women hair products dont know the exact english name for the type because there just are non for men like there is 347 in 1 shower get and a headnshoulders at max but that about it nothing for long hair really
793,male tampons and female lock straps
794,
795,ah the dove men plus care extra fresh 72 hour is like the best stuff
796,yeah but the thing is they dont even make it for men they just slap the men label on it cause they got tired of insecure men never picking good soap p
797,source edit source i made it the fuck up
798,
799,the 71 shampoo is unbearable
800,they are higher quality since when
801,as products feared toward women many times are made with more consideration with what women are looking for knowing that they tend to be pick and considerate while shopping they are marked a lot of times with natural or specially ingredient like extracts and oils that are known to be good for the skin or hair or perhaps they are free of some chemicals like sly or there organic instead men products that are like three in one body face hair wash that are just the basic sly with some synthesis fragrance 
802,there an exception which is deodorant all women products except deodorant are better quality and for the deodorant front its because depending on harmony levels your sweat will smell more or less potent higher testosterone worse smell as well as how much is produced is affected so in that case it isn quality but just effectiveness based on body types for soap though holy shit the amount of men products that are 2 in one shampoo and body wash is baffling like can you not feel the difference the hair feels so much rougher and less comfortable it feels nasty the women product cares for your hair better and improves hair health and second just makes it feel better dont use too much shampoo the its best to use shampoo once every other day and shower daily i mean if your not too depressed to do that
803,wait i can wash my hair with water everyday i thought i shouldn because it would ruin the work of the shampoo or something so give been washing my hair with shampoo every third days and whenever i took a shower i would just make sure not to wet my hair you telling me give been taking care of my hair the wrong way since forever
804,most peoples hair care information is chinese whispers because its so ubiquitous people learn whatever process they do in their childhood and then never question it when people do talk about it there just sharing all the misinformation or very based information they come to take as fact source in a guy that got into long hair in my weeks and had to research hair care
805,
806,
807,give heard men razor are better because they are for facial use no idea though because i use a lowered beard trimmed
808,i am a woman who uses men razor because there generally cheaper as far as i can tell there the same well apart from the moisturising strips on women razor that go gross and slim anyway i prefer to use razor without the slime and a nice body lotion
809,i buy men hygienic products because they seem better to me ll
810,men razor are higher quality and cheaper then women and for why 
811,beard hair is thicker there is more competition for alternative products and men generally agent willing to spend much on these products
812,not really there meant for rougher hair if your hair is rougher than yes if softer then no as someone with soft hair i could never use men razor i would get cut a lot my skin is also pretty weak so there that really they shouldn be rendered they should be watered to hair types simply sell razor as rough hair standard hair and soft hair or skin plus like so much products say men or women but are like oh yeah for 70 of men and 70 of women that true but the corps dont give a shit about the other 30 of the population
813,that not true men razor are for harder and thicker hairs women razor for the thinner softer hair they are different by nature because the body hair of women and men is different but there are of course women with more manly body hair and men with more womanly body hair and then they should buy the opposite product marketing them over hair thickness would cause too much confusion the
814,i dont really think it would cause confusion agent there a lot of hair products already marked based on hair type i feel like i can just feel my body hair and tell if its thick or thin and then buy the corresponding product it would also save some time when people are looking through the men or women section for a good razor and not realizing that they need to shop in the opposite renders section for there hair type
815,
816,i think give seen this reported about 5 times this week a new record
817,
818,you guns are buying hygienic products
819,men products with names like clean nuts n years 6 in 1 personally i am for the organ products i do the wash tone skin bolster serumampule and then moisturizer or sun screen all separate products and yes i am a guy microneedle once a week i look at least 10 years younger than my age acne scars when i was a been are getting better
820,plus i just love the smell of peaches and roses
821,i use dove men deodorant which isn as strong smelling as old spice or axe is but for body wash i use dove she butter and vanilla scent cause it just smells super good and better than what men body wash offers
822,but not when time comes to razor and foam women products suck in this category
823,
824,gifgiphy8ttebm4a5uxobz9h6tdownsized
825,i just get whatever is on the clearance rack with the missed up bottles and smashed bars of irish spring
826,shampoo is shampoo conditioned is conditioned deodorant is deodorant if it does what it needs to then it doesn matter if its cheap still works
827,yeah but some do it better
828,
829,id just say pick the stuff that you think smells nice but dont use the 3 in 1 bodywash for your hair
830,its almost like most of those hygienic products agent actually necessary to be rendered and its a weird concept except deodorant i am begging men to find good men deodorant because man sweat is more potent but also why does all men deodorant smell awful like it all smells the exact same and it just gives me a headache like holy shit i get why men use women deodorant even though it doesn fully work for them soap though women soap is just better only annoying that you gutta pay the pink tax on half of them i used to use men products and holy shit twitching to women products feels so much better it also smells better god in thinking like what other hygienic products are rendered and shouldn be anyway i saw rendered toilet paper once
831,women deodorant and antiperspirant sucks though they give up the ghost a couple hours in
832,i hate the need to have 5 different shampoo bottles in the bathroom plus i am allergic to a lot anyway never men sensitive has not failed me yet and its one of those use it for everything
833,its true that women sincere products often come with a higher price tag partly due to marketing and the wide range of specialized products sometimes men sincere items can offer similar benefits at a lower cost making them a more budgetfriendly option its worth comparing ingredient and effectiveness to find what works best for you regardless of the marketing
834,been using women body wash and lotions lately they smell a lot better than 3 in 1
835,right female razor work so breaking well why
836,
837,soon shouldn we all just collectively agree that something isn specifically masculinefeminine based on its colour or smell great
838,let boys smell nice
839,we love normalizing gettingdoing per individuals wants and needs rather than abstract invisible rules that should not be all encompassing to begin with hell yeah
840,i buy women deodorant because it is easier to find as scented the price is usually a little cheaper versus most health bands
841,this were temple was so funny until i watched the umbrella academy
842,me who uses both my body smells like spice vanilla while my hair is gathered in she butter with a little for my beard
843,this is the perfect meme temple for that scenario
844,men cheaper really
845,women hygienic products are not higher quality though
846,
847,spoiled who are these people
848,there vanya and five from the umbrella academy this shot in particular is from season 2 good show but from what i heard they kind did a got on the last season
849,they jumped the sharp in season 2
850,they just ended the show random didn even feel like it was justified by the story in season 4
851,
852,why almost every netflix show ends up being disappointing big reason why i stopped watching their shows they either get canceled or stretched out until they suddenly decide to end it without a clear end in mind
853,buying because a menthol lover
854,honestly in not pick sure i get male bodywash since smelling of flowers while working out is a little awkward but yeah for shampoo and conditioned female ones are lot easier to find and makes my hair feel much more lively
855,in finally getting the vindication i deserve on this one been using women products for years because the only option for men stuff is basic hair cleaner and basic hair cleaner in a pretensions bottle for x the price meanwhile the girl shit is actually made to treat your hair properly
856, this meme has an awesome burn hidden beneath the surfacebravo
857,when i was a kid i used the feminine wash as a scrub i remember feeling all breezy like a cold winter night
858,as a man who has showered both both i use whatever the sucks available you got flower fruit scent shit ill smell fabulous in clean that all i care about
859,women clinical strength degree antiperspirant works so much better than the men equivalent not sure why but its the only thing that keeps my pits dry all day 
860,reverse popularity
861,one of the many cosmetology majority women give dated told me long ago you can put daily moisture dove conditioned in your hair as a product honestly my hair is crazy soft holds into any style clicked back parted gerry curls even wavy and it smells great
862,brush i just want the lowest maintenance product regiment
863,this was literally me and my of i always wondered why she bought men soap etc and then i would be buying cosmetic that are gentle for women ll
864,ill say this i was flooded by the lack of deodorant for women antiperspirant as far as the eye could see and the terrible aluminium to boot
865,i buy top because it is a gender neutral product not because it stops my ass bacteria itching
866,i use a certain women perfumed since the smell of them often agent super strong and bold i prefer soothing sweet scent which women perfumed more commonly have since they match my calm soft personality and looks my most favorite has to be a perfume called winter apple from bath and bodyworks since its a soft fruit and fresh scent
867,personally i quite enjoy smelling like a fruit cocktail
868,women deodorant lasts longer and usually has scent free option it was standard in my unit in the infantry
869,really it cost me 80 bucks for the only dealing men cream option at the store while my of has 10 times more choice to pick from and her favorite is 4 times cheaper
870,top person is probably buying men deodorant for a different reason
871,i would love it if men would stop stealing my shampoo and conditioned and bought their own or like a know why dont we go allies
872,maybe in tired of smelling of wood and spaces maybe i want to smell fruit and flower today
873,nothing has done my hair justice better than verbal essence shampoo and conditioned refused with organ oil
874,absolutely true
875,men do works way better than any women do give tried soon
876,give been getting native more feminine shampoo and conditioned because the men stuff was shit and the scent are like sweat dogs cow shit
877,i grew out my hair late year had to switch shampoo conditions to women products for that exact reason for its stupid of
878,guilty actually
879,men deodorant work better but it be nice to smell like something other than arctic freeze or rakes rage
880,i borrowed a friends deodorant back in high school and it absolutely blew my mind how effective and long lasting it was the smell was pleasant too
881,the bottom part should be men using women hygienic products
882,you can cry my lush from my cold dead hands
883,my head and shoulder shampoo is the best shampoo for me other ones have made my scalp either itchy because it didn clean it enough or it have made my hair dry when it clean too much head ad shoulder is the perfect in between that why i prefer men shampoo instead of women ones they are better for my hair
884,in a pretty hairy guy and for some reason woman deodorant always worked better for me
885,i just want an antiperspirant that has no smell but i guess men have to smell some weird concept like irish spring or some is like that
886,hello in a straight man and i quite enjoy my lavender scented body wash thank you very much
887,i started to use woman stuff before i was trans its really freeing just having something that you can tell what its trying to be and just smells so good and natural but we also dont have a pink tax here in czechs so that a factor as well but i would pay extra for it still
888,on some you gutta buy women for higher quality and for some you gutta buy men since there is no difference in quality but there is pink tax
889,give locked in on what i use because its the only thing i know for sure wont trigger my skin condition i dont need quality or cheap i need safe i will avoid axe like the fucking plague
890,i as a man dont feel the need to buy as many products as women do for the 34 things i do buy i want them to be high quality
891,since when are women products better my last information was the women products are the same as for men just wrote expensive
892,
893,i was banner from vancouver for creating a second account to circumvented a previous ban when it was the first time id commented there ever and give only had one account they dont like what you said so of course they have to frivolously ban you for some made up reason its so pathetic they found out they could do that and do whenever someone offend their fragile ego
894,its one of reddish biggest flaws same thing happened to me on world news i posted a legitimate comment they said i was rolling so they permabanned me and when i ask how i was rolling or their thought process behind it i was mute
895,i got banner from a sub just for commenting on a different sub but i was told i could be unburned if i promised to never comment there again so i tell them to get bent for trying to control me and they cried to the admits and got me sitewide banner for a week
896,yeah give had that too from one of the progressive sobs as well what sort of dystopian shit is that preemptively banking someone for commenting in a different sub that they just dont like the ironic part my comment was calling out some bullshit i want even a regular commented so they have both coming credit for anyone that comments on toxic sobs
897,they claim even if your arguing in the other sub your giving them traffic and oxygen its scar stuff
898,got the exact same message
899,loading 2 minutes of hate
900,
901,same here so weak
902,
903,i got the same message from rjusticeserved because i posted on rjoerogan the reason given was that its a subreddit that spreads misinformation go on it and you find that its actually a subreddit for dunning on joe organ apparently there just really big fan of the podcast
904,it was exactly those two sobs i came across a post and decided to weigh in nothing in that post or my comment was controversial at all
905,
906,its hilarious because justiceserved used to be a super common sub to see on all and those bank used to cause a much bigger uproar then they kept doing it kept adding sobs to their filter and eventually fully killed the subreddit
907,
908,same screw rdamnthatsinteresting in my case at least
909,damn that not even political what was the other sub you were on
910,the best one to me was the time i got some message along the lines of you been banner from rflerbleflarble because you participated in rlostwumpus and then come to find out give never participated in flerbleflarble and i made one comment in lostwumpus like 10 years ago names changed to protect the innocent
911,

920,world news right now is like 2003 america literally hellbent on the destruction of the middle east in the name stopping terrorist sure many will die but he at least hamasiranisis will be gone right just gutta kill enough people and terrorist will be defeated s
921,
922,
923,your first mistake was thinking world news is a real sub its not its been taken over by political agents and propaganda both you got banner for being a real person not for the content of your comment
924,try internationalnews instead
925,rinternationalnews
926,same with me and rinthenews i made a comment about how the same person was posting the same story to all of the top news subreddits and was banner for being a downvote toll

1002,i was banner from a news subreddit for spreading misinformation in a comment where i literally didn write a single piece of information
1003,brow the inches over on rtrishahershberger banner me for crossposting a pick of her to another sub and the loses on rnsfw_gif are banking folks for asking who is in a post absolute trash going nuts with the smallest bit of power
1004,logs into one of my altaccount which make word of his whole sub
1005,i got banner from rwhitepeopletwitter for politely proving someone wrong by biting slopes
1006,i got banner from there years ago on another account for calling them out for praising the religion of peace and defending their followers whilst their sub constantly endorsed sitting on christians my rule of thumb now with any sub that makes popular is that i can tell that sub is donna be a dentist antichristian shithole if one of the subreddit rules is no islamaphobia and not no xenophobia or no hate against religion
1007,
1008,you know i the banner next time think less

1015,they are safe in the west because the skittles haired types dont know that jews come in colors other than by netanyahu
1016,true but the ones in the west most of the time dont have the guns to actually do something besides quote tikhon short because they are terrified of someone actually fighting back give seen video of some of them left pull out knives and back off immediately when the victims show they are ready to fight like they have weapons they outnumbered and they still power the moment someone doesn power pathetic
1017,
1018,
1019,
1020,for the crime of being a jewish person who dares existing on this planet
1021,oh now i feel stupid for not realizing it when you mentioned ran
1022,to be fair in pretty sure ran rates pretty much everyone at this point
1023,can confirm in pakistani and ran rates us too i think its just jews and sunny muslin maybe hindu too they hate ink about christians
1024,them to in pretty sure a lot christmas got purged there
1025,
1026,
1027,god enough with the pity party nobody is persecution you 
1028,
1029,funny because i got a week long ban for talking about israel killing palestinian and being against genocide edit ll the ole reply back with a made up sob story and block
1030,well i got a ban for talking about how i dont want to get murdered by crazy terrorist crazy world am right
1031,if you think college kiss protesting against genocide want you dead that says a lot more about you than it says about them edit they blocked me so ill post my reply here so let me get this straight you can look past a tiny minority within an otherwise peaceful and reasonable protest a protest that includes many jewish people but you can excuse the wholesale slaughter of thousands of innocent people may i kindly suggest that you reexamined your priorities
1032,their screams of death to the jews and constant harassment of jewish students and otherwise says a lot about them
1033,
1034,the kiss being combed to smithereens in gaze every day apparently
1035,nobody wants you dead ashore 
1036,so wanting israel to stop coming kiss and aid workers means i want you dead is the flavoraid that good
1037,imagine thinking the issues with palestine mean people want you dead no people would prefer israel stopped killing kiss sorry if that offend you 
1038,yeah like ah suddenly wanting israel to not commit genocide means i want them to die is such a wild logic leap give seen bushes that palestinians weren allowed of use give seen checkpoints that stopped palestinians from getting home give seen israel people moving into homes of palestinians arrested by the if give seen israel soldiers excited to kill palestinian people and go above and beyond in brutally and senseless destruction over and over and over again in the last few months acting like this is a peacekeeping mission is the height of ignorance i dont support has and i think they gone too far when i hear israel school children say they want to grow up and destroy palestine i think i know whose fault it is that has exists in the first place
1039,
1040,apologies that i dont want to get murdered by terrorist and have my friends and family rapid i know me daring to continue breathing is offensive to antiseptic asserts but unfortunately for you jews despite your best efforts have been here forever we outlived the paris once wed outlive them again
1041,why are you so obsessed with being a victim your trying to force something that straight up isn there 
1042,to be fair that a prerequisite for most to be on credit
1043,
1044,you are the ones doing the raging your country protested because your military arrested those doing the raging your country is quite literally settling the west bank where my family lives

1119,i personally chuckled cause there still more to put in the chain
1120,may got em
1121,thank you that made me actually laugh out loud
1122,everybody wants to be your enemy
1123,are they just peoples favorite at rock band to hate nowadays granted i think their first two albums are the best they done but still
1124,i agree with the first two album take
1125,in what way could they even be considered alternative there completely mainstream so they are an alternative to nothing
1126,there barely rock
1127,they are an alternative to other music genius but that about it
1128,
1129,if i had to evaluate my inherent dislike for them i think it boils down to the commercial success from a band that never seemed to release a song worthy of the hope there not a bad band but there a so many better bands that get no love and then these guns show up one day and nobody really knows why so my instinct is to assume that they have some kind of connection to the industry and that their success was less grassroots and more suits maybe my instincts are wrong and if they are id accept that but i think the sentiment is a popular one even if its misinformed
1130,i think in a lot of cases it just boils down to appealing to a broad audience a lot of people make relatively normal or tame music but the thing is that works really well for a general audience as long as it sounds good i know people who are really into music might think its boring but the average person has a different perspective or maybe i dont know what in talking about who knows
1131,as a person who rarely ever listens to music i can confirm they sound good to me the beat manages to hope me up which a bit which is good cut some days i can barely get out of bed
1132,i think most music that big these days is only big because radiostreamingrecording companies want it to be and they saturated us with it enough to justify calling it popular
1133,just because a band makes better music doesn mean that they will be more successful commercial when it comes to commercial success appealing to the masses is what makes a band stand out an average person with no real interest in the details of a song will hear songs like believer radioactive etc and think that it is fire and for a good reason
1134,i like imagine dragoons but i honestly dont like believer its boring
1135,stare they just peoples favorite at rock band to hate nowadays that a long way of writing that they suck
1136,please join me in the hate of nickelback
1137,please join me in the hate of nickelback
1138,they make pretty good music but they are overplayed its a similar thing as what happened to deeper and nickelback the industry really likes them and obviously they have fan but there people who hate everything that is popular and there often the loudest online
1139,nickelback and deeper were far better than imagine dragoons and in not a fan of either
1140,
1141,smoke and mirrors is actually very good mio
1142,ink about the album but i love the song shots i think its amazing and i like the band for that song alone
1143,are you thinking of got
1144,it went down hill quickly after that
1145,a true
1146,there not as terrible as people make them out there just repetition mio too many of their songs sound the same they are talented though no doubts there
1147,funny cause the reason why i dont really like them is because their songs are so different that i cannot understand their style
1148,this is nowhere close to a hot take they are a very popular band
1149,they make great music just dig deeper than enemy thunder believer and anything that you heard on the radio
1150, natural is my favourite
1151,sparks is my favorite 
1152,eyes closed is up there as well mio
1153,i was about to say that natural is too good
1154,zero isn bad either even if its radio friendly
1155,enemy isn bad that did feature 
1156,enemy is grated
1157,i would say almost every song on their first album was but that just me
1158,the river charming summer amsterdam easy come and easy go are the best ones in more into the lyric when it comes to imagine dragoons
1159,radioactive is pretty good
1160,wrecked i bet my life and zero are my favourite i dont like thunder or radioactive which are the more mainstream ones but demon which is mainstream is great also up there with my favourite
1161,demon still mainstream just didn see it being mentioned throughout the post
1162,hm
1163,they are pop like new age red hot child pepper or peddler nickelback
1164,always thought of them as india rock th
1165,thought they make rock pop
1166,
1167,only decent
1168,yeah like brow utf they make great music
1169,who even thinks they make not decent music gifgiphyxi3ostkpljgbm
1170,decent the old stuff hits absolutely hard
1171,i dont like them personally but music is subjective that the beauty of music
1172,i just dont really like their stuff its not bad enough to complain if it starts playing but i wont ever look for it myself
1173,they just make the kind of music you hear in a deep commercial
1174,they are the best and dont care what anyone else thinks
1175,not a hot take its radioactive
1176,not sure why you would ever pretend not to like something you like there is no such thing as shame when it comes to music that makes you feel good
1177,they do make good music but the music is just so corn like the type of music that neckbeards find empowering
1178,yeah personally my favorite sont is rafioactive where he sings oh oh oh oh a oh oh oh oh a i need a vacuum i need a vacuum
1179,in getting some flute salad vices from that font
1180,that how i feel about hardy
1181,music is subjective even the band that you think is bland and horrible still has fan 
1182,i agree th there a reason you hear them so much on the radio and in shows
1183,i just wish they never gave in they would have been so good originality always wins
1184,they are like nickelback technically decent music but so versed and overplayed i can stand hearing them anymore
1185,honestly most of their classic are beautiful bones thunder enemy radioactive warriors its time machine and natural are all songs i love at least in beatsaber
1186,their music isn my cup of tea but its not as bad as people make it out to be
1187,yeah so give always known that you can ever say you ever had sex on credit ever or everyone will freak out deny it and downvote you to oblivion thank you for confirming this
1188,i personally enjoy some of their stuff but it seems like they became the next popular band for people to rag on i dont think they are particularly amazing but they certainly agent outright bad
1189,depends on the song for me dont love any of it but i like some of it radioactive is decent demon is good for instance
1190,other take children of the sky is their best song
1191,one of those really overdramatic bands that does a lot of noah oh ah oh stuff and nothing new
1192,murray should have shot joke for this one
1193,i really dont like the singers voice its so unpleasant for the ears its like a fever dream
1194,so just another bandwagon of hate basically and if the members of the wagon find out you like them then they will typically became you for it cause their life is full of sadness and shit
1195,their old stuff maybe some of their newer stuff is just so hollow
1196,i like them and fall out boy but i frequently get them mixed up
1197,was this text written on a game boy
1198,same
1199,next hot take op is drake fan
1200,they straight up suck
1201,imagine dragoons is fine its just the way they were marked on radio stations that made a lot of people upset about them when you go to a radio station expecting hard rock that just shy of metal and you end up with pop you get pretty disappointed its kind of like if i went into a chicken wing place and they had a new flavor that was supposed to be spice and i was excited to try it but then i went in and they served me ranch dressing i like ranch dressing but that is not what i was expecting based on the description
1202,how did they get bad give only been sticking to their old songs
1203,same head give never even heard most of their songs past night visions
1204,in a big fan always looking forward for new songs but the songs of recent years agent as good as the old ones i feel like they could return a bit to their roots
1205,imagine dragoons is nickelback for millennials
1206,nickelback is nickelback for millennials
1207,not my flavor but they have a following so their music can be too bad right
1208,in waking up in waking up in waking up in waking up in waking up in waking up too in waking up in waking up in waking up in waking up in waking up in waking up
1209,i love them
1210,me too almost all of their songs are absolutely dangers
1211,if you enjoy it i wont judge you my first reaction with imagine dragoons is to run to the radio and shut it off
1212,horrible music
1213,i think the only song i genuinely listen to from them is battle cry
1214,first things first emma say all the words inside my head
1215,they have great songs demon natural machine are all dangers
1216,whatever it takes is summer 2019 them for me
1217,demon radioactive believer i like those songs bones on the other handy will be hearing this on metes
1218,i dont dislike most of their stuff except thunder that one sucks
1219,god i fucking hate that song
1220,beauty is in the eye of the bee holder sadly my queen died and all the workers buzzed off
1221,gifgiphyfhbukhmfbimzc
1222,bones
1223,i liked it when imagine dragon said cause there magic in my balls
1224,i love imagine dragoons nl
1225,my classmate and teacher actually had an argument that lasted several days about this it was mostly jokes and banter but it was still an argument and my classmate who didn like imagine dragoons she just want winning
1226,i think they are hated because they are played too often on radio stations and public places plus a lot of people who are not interested in digging deeper into music listen to them because of popularity i find their music decent but usually dont look for it to listen on purpose in into was synthpop synthwave progressive rock and classic trance
1227,imagine dragoons is a great band mio and i dont think that as controversial an opinion as the internet might make it look most of this hate seems to have started after they hit peak overlay with evolve having 3 songs dominating the radio on loop casual fan got annoyed waters crawled out of the woodwork to validity them i personally think their new stuff is great and if you liked them before you heard thunder or believer for the thousandth time try digging deeper into their catalogue my personal favorites include thief roots silent waves summer hopeless pus rocks nothing left to say if you were never a fan that your business though in genuinely curious to know what music you do prefer
1228,hilariously their less popular music is some of their best bones bad liar hesitate and yeah demon are probably their four best songs mio
1229,no they really really fucking suck horrible band with horrible music coldly sounds like beethoven next to them imagine dragoons makes bad trailer music not music for actual listening
1230,i dont mind their music just find it extremely boring
1231,they make okay music its not shit but its no danger either they are famous they make tunes that are pleasing to their fan but they are not exceptional
1232,i didn know i needed to pretend th i like clot of their music natural was my favorite as a kid
1233,operated pop slop
1234,good music poor lyric
1235,imagine dragoons is already considered at music what this world in living in
1236,wait who thought they made bad music first time hearing this
1237,i enjoy some of their songs like wrecked battle cry believer etc
1238,wait we hate imagine dragoons this is breaking news to me
1239,i quite like them i agree
1240,the imagine dragging deep nuts across your face joke is the best thing to have come from imagine dragoons
1241,reminds me of nickel back situation
1242,i dont think their songs are bad i think all their songs sound exactly the same the take the soundtrack of believer and overlay it with any song they have it would not sound out of place
1243,take straight from the ice age
1244,ink about albums and stuff but i love early songs by imagine dragoons never understood the hate i dont like recent once like believer and thunder
1245,how is this a hot take they are like one of like three bandsartists actually making current pop music worth listening right now
1246,i must live under a rock give never met anyone who didn like imagine dragoons
1247,hot take one of the most well known bands in the world is good yeah okay muddy
1248,they are mid their first album was good since it was original and they just went to being insanely mid their music seems like a bottle of itself is the best way i can describe it lazy boring and lacking any real creative vision this is coming from someone who used to love their stuff
1249,not a fan but i saw them live in 2017 and it was if not the best then definitely one of the top three concerts give ever seen dan reynolds is a great footman
1250,bruhhhhh
1251,yeah in my opinion its decent though not really my favorite
1252,not even lukewarm
1253,i mean of course they do its not a band id regularly listen to but if i heard them at a party or whatever id vice to them
1254,of gifgiphyf9rgybt2tttvhiingw
1255,all are pretending
1256,agreed decent not exceptional not bad decent
1257,in listening to it right now so yes
1258,brow creditors need to go outside imagine dragoons is a passively popular and liked band they have a couple of songs with a billion views one couture for sucks sake op has to be ragebating
1259,i like them in my arcade into and that is enough
1260,their music isn bad its just very overplayed
1261,imagine
1262,is that really a hot take i never knew imagine dragoons was so controversial
1263,oh the misery every single person is my enemy oh the treachery every single person wants to be my enemy my en em he he truly amazing lyric
1264,they had some good trailer songs and i understand why kiss would like them sort of like the tillers for 2010s but not as cool i dont listen to them but i respect them to extent i have no ill will towards them they just dont really tickle my fancy
1265,freezing cold take mio ah in bidding some people just hop on the bandwagon is my guess and that why its apparently rates also because the music is liked by more of the edge kiss but you dont have to feel like you relate to something to like it which is what they dont get i guess
1266,only elder gen alpha like it my first d was offspring american so yeah in not going to like imagine dragoons
1267,yeah decent that about it some of their tunes are decent
1268,imagine dragon deep nut ha got make really good music
1269,i like the imagine dragoons song and then they released it 12 times across different albums
1270,my girlfriend like them and its easily my least favorite thing about her
1271,imagine dragoons makes music for contemporary churches you can change my mind
1272,ah yes the simple fact that other people will inevitably have the other opinion clearly meme worthy every time
1273,honestly yeah their sound can be kind of genetic outside of a few songs but they are often still quite good songs wouldn call them bad they are easily a safe pick if your ensure what people would like mio
1274,i used to love them with crazy passion in the first album but then they became super mainstream every album sounds the same mio they are everywhere and i got tired of them to the point i can stand them anymore so i avoid them like the plague and if they come in a soundtrack which is very often lately in the middle of a movie it makes me sick to my stomach ink why i mean music is subjective and they clearly have lots of fan so they must be doing something good in just over them
1275,the ultimate made up battles in my own head meme temple
1276,brow even nickelback makes good music problem is every other song uses the same formula 
1277,thunder thunder thunder then thunder thunthunthunder thunder thunder thunder then thunder thunthunthunder thunder
1278,delete
1279,that the line after that
1280,who doesn think imagine dragoons make awesome music i may be based but fuck yeah when imagine dragoons is next on my scuffle
1281,radioactive is so good same with enemy and bad liar
1282,ink due sounds good the lyric may not be the groundbreaking but they sing perfectly serviceable songs
1283,yes there good yes there overplayed
1284,garage band garage music
1285,this is me but with air
1286,delete
1287,for some people yes but for others they still enjoy their music and i get it not everyone likes air but why of down vote me
1288,i dont understand the hate sure their lyric agent ground breaking or whatever but i like to listen to them when i want to set a vice
1289,its honestly a very hot take there like red hot child pepper there good very good thing is they just made one good song amp extended it over 3 albums

1584,i have a feeling modern kiss would get behind this tends being cyclical as they are they already want to mimi the was and was and watching the did log was certainly entertaining to bored millennium classroom it reminds me of the fish screensaver where one would eat the other when they crossed paths
