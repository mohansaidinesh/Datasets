798,,neutral
799,the 71 shampoo is unbearable,neutral
800,they are higher quality since when,positive
801,as products feared toward women many times are made with more consideration with what women are looking for knowing that they tend to be pick and considerate while shopping they are marked a lot of times with natural or specially ingredient like extracts and oils that are known to be good for the skin or hair or perhaps they are free of some chemicals like sly or there organic instead men products that are like three in one body face hair wash that are just the basic sly with some synthesis fragrance ,positive
802,there an exception which is deodorant all women products except deodorant are better quality and for the deodorant front its because depending on harmony levels your sweat will smell more or less potent higher testosterone worse smell as well as how much is produced is affected so in that case it isn quality but just effectiveness based on body types for soap though holy shit the amount of men products that are 2 in one shampoo and body wash is baffling like can you not feel the difference the hair feels so much rougher and less comfortable it feels nasty the women product cares for your hair better and improves hair health and second just makes it feel better dont use too much shampoo the its best to use shampoo once every other day and shower daily i mean if your not too depressed to do that,positive
803,wait i can wash my hair with water everyday i thought i shouldn because it would ruin the work of the shampoo or something so give been washing my hair with shampoo every third days and whenever i took a shower i would just make sure not to wet my hair you telling me give been taking care of my hair the wrong way since forever,negative

809,i buy men hygienic products because they seem better to me ll,positive
810,men razor are higher quality and cheaper then women and for why ,positive
811,beard hair is thicker there is more competition for alternative products and men generally agent willing to spend much on these products,positive
812,not really there meant for rougher hair if your hair is rougher than yes if softer then no as someone with soft hair i could never use men razor i would get cut a lot my skin is also pretty weak so there that really they shouldn be rendered they should be watered to hair types simply sell razor as rough hair standard hair and soft hair or skin plus like so much products say men or women but are like oh yeah for 70 of men and 70 of women that true but the corps dont give a shit about the other 30 of the population,positive
813,that not true men razor are for harder and thicker hairs women razor for the thinner softer hair they are different by nature because the body hair of women and men is different but there are of course women with more manly body hair and men with more womanly body hair and then they should buy the opposite product marketing them over hair thickness would cause too much confusion the,positive
814,i dont really think it would cause confusion agent there a lot of hair products already marked based on hair type i feel like i can just feel my body hair and tell if its thick or thin and then buy the corresponding product it would also save some time when people are looking through the men or women section for a good razor and not realizing that they need to shop in the opposite renders section for there hair type,positive

832,i hate the need to have 5 different shampoo bottles in the bathroom plus i am allergic to a lot anyway never men sensitive has not failed me yet and its one of those use it for everything,negative
833,its true that women sincere products often come with a higher price tag partly due to marketing and the wide range of specialized products sometimes men sincere items can offer similar benefits at a lower cost making them a more budgetfriendly option its worth comparing ingredient and effectiveness to find what works best for you regardless of the marketing,positive

1127,they are an alternative to other music genius but that about it,negative
1128,,neutral
1129,if i had to evaluate my inherent dislike for them i think it boils down to the commercial success from a band that never seemed to release a song worthy of the hope there not a bad band but there a so many better bands that get no love and then these guns show up one day and nobody really knows why so my instinct is to assume that they have some kind of connection to the industry and that their success was less grassroots and more suits maybe my instincts are wrong and if they are id accept that but i think the sentiment is a popular one even if its misinformed,positive
1130,i think in a lot of cases it just boils down to appealing to a broad audience a lot of people make relatively normal or tame music but the thing is that works really well for a general audience as long as it sounds good i know people who are really into music might think its boring but the average person has a different perspective or maybe i dont know what in talking about who knows,positive
1131,as a person who rarely ever listens to music i can confirm they sound good to me the beat manages to hope me up which a bit which is good cut some days i can barely get out of bed,positive
1132,i think most music that big these days is only big because radiostreamingrecording companies want it to be and they saturated us with it enough to justify calling it popular,positive
1133,just because a band makes better music doesn mean that they will be more successful commercial when it comes to commercial success appealing to the masses is what makes a band stand out an average person with no real interest in the details of a song will hear songs like believer radioactive etc and think that it is fire and for a good reason,positive

1225,my classmate and teacher actually had an argument that lasted several days about this it was mostly jokes and banter but it was still an argument and my classmate who didn like imagine dragoons she just want winning,positive
1226,i think they are hated because they are played too often on radio stations and public places plus a lot of people who are not interested in digging deeper into music listen to them because of popularity i find their music decent but usually dont look for it to listen on purpose in into was synthpop synthwave progressive rock and classic trance,negative
1227,imagine dragoons is a great band mio and i dont think that as controversial an opinion as the internet might make it look most of this hate seems to have started after they hit peak overlay with evolve having 3 songs dominating the radio on loop casual fan got annoyed waters crawled out of the woodwork to validity them i personally think their new stuff is great and if you liked them before you heard thunder or believer for the thousandth time try digging deeper into their catalogue my personal favorites include thief roots silent waves summer hopeless pus rocks nothing left to say if you were never a fan that your business though in genuinely curious to know what music you do prefer,positive
